Netflix Content Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes the Netflix Content 2023 dataset to explore trends in viewership across different content types, languages, and release timelines. 
Using Python and Plotly, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations to uncover insights about Netflix’s content strategy.



Key Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Compare shows vs. movies based on total viewership hours.

Analyze language-based consumption trends.

Study release month patterns to identify seasonal trends.

Visualize findings using interactive dashboards.



Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Plotly Express & Graph Objects for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for analysis



Key Insights

Shows outperform movies in total hours viewed.

English dominates Netflix’s viewership, followed by Korean and other languages, highlighting a global reach.

Seasonal release patterns suggest content drops in specific months influence viewership.



Future Work

1.Build a predictive model to forecast viewership trends.

2.Explore genre-wise performance.

3.Automate visual dashboards with Dash/Streamlit



The data reveals that Netflix has strategically released content around key holidays and events. Some of the significant releases include:

New Year’s Period: The Glory: Season 1, La Reina del Sur: Season 3, and Kaleidoscope: Limited Series were released close to New Year’s Day, resulting in high viewership.

Valentine’s Day: Perfect Match: Season 1 and The Romantics: Limited Series were released on February 14th, which align with a romantic theme and capitalize on the holiday’s sentiment.


Conclusion

So, the content strategy of Netflix revolves around maximizing viewership through targeted release timing and content variety. Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership, with significant spikes in December and June, indicating strategic releases around these periods. The Fall season stands out as the peak time for audience engagement. Most content is released on Fridays, which aims to capture viewers right before the weekend, and viewership aligns strongly with this release pattern. While the number of releases is steady throughout the year, viewership varies, which suggests a focus on high-impact titles and optimal release timing over sheer volume.
