Netflix Content Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes the Netflix Content 2023 dataset to explore trends in viewership across different content types, languages, and release timelines. 
Using Python and Plotly, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and interactive visualizations to uncover insights about Netflix’s content strategy.



Key Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
Compare shows vs. movies based on total viewership hours.
Analyze language-based consumption trends.
Study release month patterns to identify seasonal trends.
Visualize findings using interactive dashboards.



Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Plotly Express & Graph Objects for visualization
Jupyter Notebook for analysis



Key Insights

Shows outperform movies in total hours viewed.
English dominates Netflix’s viewership, followed by Korean and other languages, highlighting a global reach.
Seasonal release patterns suggest content drops in specific months influence viewership.



Future Work

Build a predictive model to forecast viewership trends.
Explore genre-wise performance.
Automate visual dashboards with Dash/Streamlit
